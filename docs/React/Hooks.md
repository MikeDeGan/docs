# Hooks

## Why Hooks

Hooks overcomes many of the issues that we come across when using class based components. 

- Calling Super(props) is annoying
- Classes make knowing how 'this' works difficult at times
- Organizing components by life-cycle methods forces us to sprinkle related logic throughout our components.
- React has no good primitive for sharing non-visual logic.

## Just use Functions

Using functions instead of classes removes the Super(props) and 'this' issues right away. Ok great now what about state and life-cycle methods, they are kind of handy.
